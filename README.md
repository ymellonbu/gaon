# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a developer who focuses on building **Discord bots** that make servers cleaner, more fun, and more interactive.

I love taking small ideas and turning them into features—  
from moderation tools to economy systems, interactive mini-games, and useful utilities.

- 🧩 Utility commands (tickets, authentication, role trading)  
- 🗄️ SQLite-based data storage per server

## 🎯 My Style
